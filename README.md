🌌 Interactive Galaxy Simulation (HTML + Canvas)
This project is a simple interactive galaxy/starfield simulation built using pure HTML with embedded JavaScript. It simulates a rotating galaxy by animating hundreds of colorful stars orbiting a central core.

✨ Features
Rotating starfield effect

Procedurally generated stars

Colorful orbiting animation using HSL color values

Fully contained in a single HTML file

Responsive to screen size changes

🚀 Live Demo
You can open the HTML file in any modern browser to see the simulation in action.

No build steps. No external dependencies. Just open index.html.

📁 Files
index.html – Main HTML file containing all code (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

🛠️ How It Works
A <canvas> is used for rendering.

Stars are randomly generated in circular orbits around the center of the screen.

Each star moves slightly every frame to simulate orbiting.

The canvas fades slightly each frame to create trailing effects.

🧠 Concepts Used
HTML5 <canvas>

JavaScript animation with requestAnimationFrame()

HSL color manipulation

Responsive canvas resizing

Polar coordinates to simulate circular motion
